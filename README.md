# Chess Engine

This was my second Python project ever.

In this project I made a chess engine that allows you to play chess against another person in the same computer.

It allows you to move all pieces according to chess rules, capture pieces, give checks and checkmate.
To play, you click on the piece you want to move, and the square you want it to move. White player always starts, and it swaps turns after a move is made.

It saves all moves made similar to how chess notation works, by saving the square the piece was and the one it moved to.

Currently it does not support special moves like  pawn promotion, capture en passant, or castling. Pins dont work either. There is no draw ruleset.
